        <p>
          Passionate about technology for years, I've decided to change my
          career path and gain a deep understanding of programming and computer
          science.
          <br />
          For this reason, I graduated Full Stack Developer
          (Rails/Html/Css/Postgres) from Le Wagon in 2022 ‚úÖ
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I want to learn more and take up new challenges. I am motivated
          and interested to continue to learn. As a job seeker, it's possible
          for me to be hired using POEl or AFPR in partnership with P√¥le Emploi,
          this would help the company hiring me during the first 3 months ü§ù
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, I'll keep on building my skills and developing
          projects in React + Next.js. Happy to chat ‚òï
